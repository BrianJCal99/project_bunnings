1,Cleo&Maddie M,5,a month ago,Purchased the Bosch Cordless Hand Trimmer with 3 attachments. Absolutely fantastic. Will be tackling the hedges and getting garden ready for a lovely Spring & Summer.....also previously purchased a bag of Gypsum which l sprinkled on soil before seeding new lawn. Works brilliantly!! Great products. Cheers.
2,Emily Withford,5,a week ago,"The team at Port Melbourne Bunnings has offered me the most amazing customer service. I ordered click and collect accidentally (meant to have it delivered), after one phone call they had it delivered within an hour. They are so incredibly accomodating and I will definitely be coming back."
3,Tony Wenz,4,2 weeks ago,"EDIT 2025: Still going strong. Got my plumbing supplies. Team member approached to offer help. Nice service! Big store. Everything for the handyman or Tradie. Dont trust the app for stocks or location. It sent me to aisle 101 when it was in aisle 7. Lol Pets welcome. EDIT: Score! Sausage Sizzle today!!! üç£ EDIT: The app sent me to the wrong aisle again. It cannot tell the difference between the 'home' location, and a temp 'pop-up' aisle display."
4,Julian De Bortoli,1,in the last week,Service here sucks! I had to wait 25 minutes for a customer in the paint section to be served while 2 Bunnings staff member were standing by. All I wanted to was a can of spray paint and it only required them to open the cage. Both staff standing there said it wasn't their section. Seriously!! You need to be trained to take a pair of keys and open a cage. Worst service always here. Staff show zero initiative for customer service. Do better Bunnings!
5,Robbert Craig,5,3 months ago,Came in last week and can't stop thinking about the wonderful experience I had. I had a click and collect and was attended to by Ryan and he went above and beyond to ensure that everything was done to what I asked and helped me with every step! I've been served by him before and every time it's a pleasure! His responsive and authentic attitude and chat honestly brightened my day! This employee is exactly what customer service should be!
